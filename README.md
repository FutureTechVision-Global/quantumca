# QuantumCA™ Dashboard

A futuristic, glassmorphic AI-powered dashboard system designed for 2050-ready adaptive intelligence.  
This project provides a **modular, transparent, and extensible UI framework** for QuantumCA™.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Glassmorphic Design** (transparent, futuristic look)
- **Modular Tabs** for Intake, Analysis, Insights, Ledger, and Controls
- **Mock Data Ready** (easily replace with real APIs)
- **Responsive Grid Layout** (desktop, tablet, mobile optimized)
- **Accessibility AA+** (keyboard navigation, aria labels)
- **Trust-by-Design** (audit trail, ledger logging, explainability zones)
- **CI/CD** ready with GitHub Actions + Netlify
- **Deploy Anywhere** (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel, or self-hosted)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/quantumca-dashboard.git
cd quantumca-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
🌐 Deployment
GitHub Pages
Push to your repo

Enable Pages under Settings > Pages

GitHub Actions (ci.yml) will auto-deploy on push to main

Netlify
Connect repo on Netlify dashboard

Set build command: npm run build

Set publish directory: dist

Or use included netlify.toml for automatic config

📊 Tabs Overview
Dashboard (default landing)

Intake Hub (data ingestion & connectors)

Analysis Engine (AI forecasts & scenarios)

Insights Deck (real-time intelligence feed)

Trust Ledger (audit trails & compliance)

User Controls (profile, preferences, and system settings)

🤖 Mock Data
All tabs come with hypothetical demo data (src/data/) so you can preview without a backend.
Replace JSON files with live APIs as needed.

🔄 CI/CD
GitHub Actions (ci.yml) → builds & deploys automatically on push.

Netlify → continuous deployment on push.

🧭 Roadmap
 Add live data connectors

 Integrate AI assistant widget

 Multi-user roles and access control

 Advanced visualization (3D holographic charts)

 Voice and gesture input (future phase)
